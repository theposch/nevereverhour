### Working with Everhour API
All requests must include the `X-Api-Key` header with a valid API key. The API key must have appropriate permissions for the endpoints being accessed.

### Making API calls using curl
When testing or making a call to the API, we can use curl to make the requests. first ensure the environment variable `EVERHOUR_API_KEY` is set. @env.local

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.everhour.com/team/users" -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```


Example usage:
```bash
curl -H "X-Api-Key: $EVERHOUR_API_KEY" "https://api.everhour.com/reports/time?from=2024-01-01&to=2024-03-19" | jq
```
